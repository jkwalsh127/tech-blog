# Description
This project was an exercise in building my first full-stack application from scratch! The application functions as a blog site. Any visitor is greeted with a list of posts added to the site. Any of these posts can be clicked to view the comments that users left on it. However, the ability to create, delete, or edit posts requires a user to register a username and password, and be logged in for the current session. The application is deployed using heroku and is equipped with a database to store user credentials, posts, and comments that were made by users. Building both the front and back-end to this application took a decent amount of effort but was a very enlightening process.
This project also involved using libraries and frameworks like Handlebars and Tailwind. These tools shortened the amount of time it would've taken to acheive a similar build-out, especially one that is mobile-first, responsive, and able to handle the tiling of a growing page.
